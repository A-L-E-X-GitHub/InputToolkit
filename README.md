# InputToolkit
Written using the .NET Framekwork 4.8 in visual studios 2022.

The InputToolkit (originally named MouseHelper) is a application that lets the user set mouse events and delays to then play them back whenever desired.
It was intended for the project to also allow keystrokes from the keyboard but due to time constraints it was never added.

- The application can be ran with the InputToolkit.exe file, it does not require any other files.
- The primary source files can be found in the forms folder.
